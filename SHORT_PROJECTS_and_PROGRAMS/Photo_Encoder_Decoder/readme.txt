 I have included 2 screenshots for encryption and decryption called
 encode.png and decode.png.
 Note that when you open screenshots, left window is the input image
 and the right window is the output image.

 If the computer says that "Output Image File is not responding",
 please click on "Wait" button. Then it will properly, work.
 DO NOT click on "Force Quit" button,
 I promise you that my program will work if you wait.

 Please follow these command format example so my program works properly.
    1. To encode original file:
        ./PhotoMagic original.png encoded_output.png 1011011000110110
    2. To decode encoded file:
        ./PhotoMagic encoded_output.png decoded_output.png 1011011000110110

 The original.png is my own photo that I took while I was in Japan
 couple years ago and feel free to use it.

 Thanks!
