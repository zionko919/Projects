BOWS (Be One with the Snow) 

************************************************************************************
Introduction of BOWS Web Application:
According to the research done in 2020, the estimated number of skiers and 
snowboarders visits in the United States is more than 50 million. 
Be One with the Snow is a web-based application that targets these skiers and 
snowboarders in Massachusetts and eventually all United States to find, organize, 
plan, and experience mountains and ski resorts much easier. Skiers and snowboarders 
can now do not have to visit various websites to research information they need. 
Simply, they need to reach our application and enter their desired mountain or resorts, 
and the web application would have every information ready for them.

Project Design
The applicationâ€™s UI interface is primarily structured with HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript with help from Node.js and React. We have used Node.js and React to 
provide major simplification to interaction codes and for the connection between 
the front-end and the back-end. They would be used for single-page navigation via 
their routing capabilities. Bootstrap is used to add some flexibility to the 
front-end design. It helps to make the application responsive.
The database used in the application resides in MongoDB. The database in JSON format 
for each resort are created. The database is formatted in a way to 
easily access and get information about our mountains with their unique ID, name, 
link, description, prices, reviews, image, and so on. This database is used to 
populate the page at the front-end where it is appropriate.
