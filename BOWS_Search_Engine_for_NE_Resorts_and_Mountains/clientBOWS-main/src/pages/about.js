                    Be One with the Snow is a web-based application that targets skiers
                    and snowboarders across the United States to find, organize, plan, and
                    experience mountains and ski resorts much easier. Consumers do not have
                    to visit various websites to research information they need. Simply, they need to
                    reach our application and enter their zip-code, and we will have every information
                    ready for them.
