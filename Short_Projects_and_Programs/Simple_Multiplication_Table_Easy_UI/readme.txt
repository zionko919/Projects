Description:
Not much has been changed for my html and css files but I did some
style changes because of the newly created tabs. Other than
adding jQuery files in html and changing error message color in css.
I pretty much only worked with my js file "mult_table.js"
I downloaded and implemented with jQuery minified Javascript file.
I implemented jQuery Validation plugin. I had to download the file.
from https://jqueryvalidation.org/ because something went wrong for
an unknown reason. I have save those files in validator folder.
So my website has two tabs at the start. Multiplication Table Maker
and Delete All Tabs (Destroy All). Then when you move sliders and
if there are no errors. You can create new tabs with table saved
accordingly by clicking the Create Table Tab button. To delete your
created tabs you can click on the X icon on the right of your created
tabs. Also, you can delete everything by clicking on Delete All Tabs
(Destroy All). Also, when you move the slider, you can see that the
button displays the integer that you are in dynamically.
You can also, input your desired integer into the input box.
On Multiplication Table Maker tab, there is a button that goes to
my website directly. Also, there is a button that scrolls to the
top right away on the bottom right.
Also, my implementation make the error show up right away and
responsive depending on user's input. I have customized my error
messages and they should correctly pop up next to the input box.
My comments will be next to the input boxes in RED.
